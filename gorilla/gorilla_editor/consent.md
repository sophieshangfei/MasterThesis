**Title of Study**: Social Decision Making

**Department**: Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research

___ 

Thank you for agreeing to take part in this online study of motivation, vigor and decision making. Before you decide to take part, please read the information above and consent form below carefully. The study is anonymous, and we will not collect personally identifiable data or try to identify you from the data. We use your username to pay you for your participation but, as some usernames include real names, we will delete your username (and any other personal information) from our records after the study is finished.

**What is the project’s purpose?**

We aim to better understand human decision making and motivation. The games you will be asked to play are based on laboratory experiments we have developed at UCL. Our aim is to develop deeper understandings of human behaviour using mathematical (or ‘computational’) in an effort to improve our understanding of mental illnesses.

**Why have I been chosen?**

We will test healthy adult volunteers aged 18 years or over and we will ask them to confirm their eligibility in the consent process. For this study we are inviting Prolific users to take part.

**Do I have to take part?**

It is up to you to decide whether to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be asked to read and agree to a consent form. You can withdraw at any time without giving a reason. If you decide to withdraw you will be asked what you wish to happen to the data you have provided up that point.

**What will happen to me if I take part?**

You will play one or more online computer games, which will last **10-15 minutes**. You will be reimbursed for helping us. However, if you decide to leave the study early without completing (returned submissions) or time-out after becoming inactive (timed-out submissions), you will be excluded from the study automatically and will not get paid in the end. The spaces that were previously filled then become available to new participants.

The amount you receive depends on your performance, and the minimum amount you will receive is **£INSERT NUMBER HERE**. The amount you earn can vary with how fast you react in the games. You are free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason. Although the general nature of the game/task you will be asked to perform will be explained to you, research designs often require that the specific details of the study are not fully explained.

**What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?**

There are no significant risks or disadvantages for taking part.

**What are the possible benefits of taking part?**

As described above, you will be reimbursed for taking part in this study. You will also be contributing to cognitive research.

**What if something goes wrong?**

If you wish to raise a concern or a complaint, please contact [up-to-date contact information]. If you feel your complaint is not handled to your satisfaction, please contact the UCL ethics team (ethics@ucl.ac.uk)

**Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?**

We will not be collecting any personally identifiable data from you (such as your name or date of birth). The data from the games and questionnaires will be stored anonymously. We will store your Prolific username only until data collection has finished for this study to ensure that you can be reimbursed. Once the study is closed, because many people include their real name in their username, your username will be deleted and the data will be stored without your username. All data will be stored securely on Gorilla’s servers and after study completion, only fully anonymised data will be stored on secure UCL computers and servers.

**What will happen to the results of the research project?**

When analysed and stored the data from this study will be anonymised (by removing your username), retained indefinitely, and might be used for future research projects in addition to the study you are currently participating in. We will publish the data in scientific journals and data may be made available to the general public via data repositories. There is no way that anyone will be able to identify you from this publicly shared data.
